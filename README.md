# Temperature-Prediction
This is an LR model trained to predict temperature based on humidity and pressure.
Things I learned after working on this model:
Feature Engineering: Feature engineering is the process of creating, modifying, or selecting features (input variables) to improve a machine learning modelâ€™s performance. It helps the model learn better relationships between inputs and the target variable.
Dummy coding (One-hot encoding): change continuous variable into categorical value (0 and 1)
Interpolation: Interpolation is a technique used to estimate unknown values between two known data points. It is commonly used in data science, engineering, and mathematics to fill in missing data or create smooth curves.

Feature Scaling: Feature scaling is the process of normalizing or standardizing numerical data so that different features contribute equally to a model. This is especially important in machine learning and deep learning, where different scales can negatively impact model performance.
